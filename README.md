# dragview

This Flutter app demos an easy way of adding an **overlay** container in a Stack that can be dragged up and down to resize and reveal it content.

The demo uses a stack with 2 widgets, the background one is purple with the text "Hello" on, the other one in the foreground is the *VerticalDragContainer* defined in the dragable.dart file.

To drag the container up (or down) the screen just click and hold the green bar while moving your finger(or mouse) up and down.

## Updates
